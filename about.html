          <p>Jordie Saenz is an indie folk songwriter from Southern California. As he begins to emerge in the indie folk scene, he is often compared to Sufjan Stevens, Radical Face, and Iron & Wine.</p>
          <p>With hushed vocals and fingerpicked strings over ambient soundscapes and baroque-influenced compositions,  Saenz marries traditional folk elements with modern music. Combining philosophy, religious symbolism, and personal experience, Jordie's lyrics guide the listener to contemplative and introspect states of mind.</p>
          <p>After releasing his first EP, <a href="/music/albums/the-northern-state">The Northern State</a>, on November 11, 2016, Saenz quickly following up with the release of a singe, <a href="/music/singles/new-suit">New Suit</a>, on January 6, 2017. Currently, Jordie is recording songs for another EP planned for release in late 2017.</p>
