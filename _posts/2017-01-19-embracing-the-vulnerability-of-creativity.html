<p>I've always been a creative person.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, Mom would drag me to my brother's baseball games, and my rascally little self would scurry off into the nearest thing that could be called "nature" (probably a few bushes and trees) and be transported to another world in my imagination. At age 10 I began to toy with different vehicle of expressing this inner world: music. I started dabbling with the guitars that were scattered around my home (thanks Dad!), tender fingers on sturdy steel strings, stretching to uncomfortable positions and discovering the relationships between shapes and sounds. As soon I was able to play a few chords chords, I was writing songs.</p>

<p>Since then, I've been writing songs and playing music as my primary expression of myself, pretending to take notes in class, when in reality I was jotting down lyrics. By the time I graduated high school I must have written at least 30 songs, my head continuously buzzing with compositions and words set to melody and rhythm and rhyme. It became part of my identity. People knew me as a songwriter and a musician and a creative person. More importantly, I knew myself as a songwriter and musician and a creative person.</p>

<p>But at some point, I stopped creating as much. Some of the reasons for this were good: I fell in love, got married, started a career. On the other hand, some of the reasons for this were not: I took the discouragement of technically difficulties (somehow recording equipment would break right at the moment when I decided to make a song) as a sign that I shouldn't make music; I agreed with the lies that I wasn't good enough, or that the songs I wrote didn't matter. I stopped making music like I used to. People didn't know me as a creative person. I didn't think of myself as one either. I felt like I had lost a part of myself.</p>

<p>In 2015, I set out to record an EP, thanks to a lot of love and encouragement from my wife. It took about a year from start to finish, and was painfully vulnerable. I would shut myself in to the tiny little closet (honestly, it was SO SMALL) with a guitar and fight tooth and nail against the lies that I had been believing about myself and about my creativity. I would keep trying to make it perfect, recording until my fingers were raw and my mouth was dry.</p>

<p>On November 11, 2016, <a href="/music/albums/the-northern-state">I released The Northern State</a>, my first official solo music release. Whether or not it's perfect isn't a concern to me anymore; perfection is a fight I know I'll always lose. The important thing to me is that I did it, and I am doing it. What happened in the closet when I was recording music was less about trying to release music that would win the world over; it was about breaking agreements with the lies that prevented me from expressing myself, the rusty manacles that held me back from doing what felt as much a part of me as my fingerprints. It was about being vulnerable. As <a href="http://brenebrown.com/">Brené Brown</a> says, “Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change.”</p>

<p>2016 was a year full of overcoming insecurities and breaking agreements with lies I had told myself that held me back from being myself and doing what I love to do. If you love to create, whether it be music, writing, photography, dancing, painting, or anything you could possibly imagine, but are held back from doing so, I hope you take encouragement from my experience. Take heart. You might find that the world isn't actually dark, and that you've just had your eyes shut. Take the risk of vulnerability and fight whatever's got you tied down.</p>

<p>This year, I will keep going. I will keep writing and recording songs. I will keep putting myself out there, embracing the vulnerability of creativity.</p>

<p>This blog will be a place where I document my experiences, share knowledge I gather along the way as I pursue my creative endeavors. I hope it serves as a helpful resource for you. Please feel free to reach out if you ever want to talk about music, creativity, vulerability, Adventure Time, memes, or literally anything. I'm down to chat. Let's get coffee.</p>
