<p>A few weeks ago, I conducted a survey geared towards songwriting.</p>

<p>As a songwriter, I'm really interested in other songwriters' strengths, areas for growth, aspirations, and influences. So I put together a set of questions like "What songs do you find yourself coming back to again and again?" and "Who are some songwriters you admire?" I also asked what areas of songwriting (lyrics, melody, chord progression, song structure) are the most difficult, as well as the genres of music they are writing for. I was overwhelmed by the amount of people who filled out the survey, and the results were incredibly interesting!</p>

<h3>What song(s) do you find yourself coming back to again and again?</h3>

<p>I compiled a playlist of songs that songwriters considered their favorites, or songs that they kept coming back to. You can follow and listen to the playlist on Spotify, just click the playlist art below:</p>

<p class="text-center"><a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1214932815/playlist/22SsyDllALH6YD5g25LScz" target="_blank"><img style="max-width: 420px; margin: auto;" src="https://d3rt1990lpmkn.cloudfront.net/640/7051775737cc7561a41b974138139f55a9d7ce9e"></a></p>

<p>It's really fun to see the diversity in genre and style, and there's something special about knowing that every song on this playlist is one of another artist's favorite songs.</p>

<h3>Who are some songwriters you admire?</h3>

<p>The top names that showed up for peoples' favorite songwriters was probably the most surprising result. Here are the top three songwriters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Justin Vernon: about 10%</li>
  <li>Sufjan Stevens: about 8%</li>
  <li>Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan (it was a tie!): about 7%</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, Justin Vernon and Sufjan Stevens are two of my favorite songwriters ever. It's cool to know that my fellow songwriters and I can connect over this. I'm excited to see what kind of music comes from these next few years with so many songwriters being inluenced by these two, as they are highly innovative and push the boundaries of modern songwriting. That being said, it's not surprising to see McCartney and Dylan on this list. Their songwriting has held up for decades and are still influential to this day. I grew up listening to Bob Dylan, and his lyrics (especially in "Every Grain of Sand") are some of the most beautifully written lyrics.</p>

<h3>What style / genre of music are you currently writing or would like to write?</h3>

<p>The top results in genres were a bit hard to count, since genres blur lines a lot. If a word appeared in the genre that people submitted, I counted it. For instance, if somebody said "alternative shoegaze post-folk", I would count that as all of the genres mentioned (alternative, shoegaze, folk). That being said, here are the top results for genre:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rock: about 38%</li>
  <li>Folk: about 31%</li>
  <li>Pop: about 29%</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing that was surprising to me was that Pop was so high on the list. I'm not sure why that surprises me, probably just personal bias since most of my songwriting has been in the folk / rock realm, and I didn't get in to pop until recently.</p>

<h3>Where do you struggle most in songwriting?</h3>

<p>As a songwriting insructor, this question appealed to me most. I really want to know what hurdles people face when it comes to songwriting, so I can collect and compile resources for people to help them grow in songwriting. Writing songs for me is an instrumental part in maintain spiritual, emotional, and mental health. I strongly believe that using putting your heart and mind to music and lyrics is a healthy and beneficial way of dealing with issues and expressing yourself. That being said, here are the results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lyrics: 53%</li>
  <li>Melody: 43%</li>
  <li>Song Structure: 29%</li>
  <li>Chord Progression: 27%</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn't really have any expectations for this portion of the survey, so I'm not at all surprised that Lyrics is the main struggle for more than half of songwriters. Finding and crafting words is incredibly difficult, especially if self-expression is part of the equation.</p>

<h3>What next?</h3>

<p>It's been really cool to get a feel for what the songwriting community is all about. I feel united to this group of online songwriters, listening to your favorite songs and bonding over favorite songwriters. Furthermore, I feel with you all the struggles of songwriting.</p>

<p>I want to use this blog and my insatiable desire to gather resources about music and songwriting and make this a place where I can share information, tips, advice, and my own experience of songwriting with you all. I'll use the results from above to guide what sort of content I compile and create (so you can be expecting some stuff about writing lyrics soon!). If that interests you, feel free to follow along. If not, no worries, I'm not gonna force anyone to do anything.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you find the results of the survey as interesting as I do!</p>
