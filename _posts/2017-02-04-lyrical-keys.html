<p>When I was in 7<sup>th</sup> grade, I was given an assignment to write a song. I kept going through idea after idea, unable to hold on to one long enough to actually do anything. After a while of wrestling with this frustration, I went up to my teacher and said, "I don't know what to write about, I can't think of anything." She looked at me sincerely, told me something along the lines of, "I think the problem is that you're thinking of too many things. You have so many ideas, and you just need to choose one."</p>

<p>I honestly think this is the struggle many people have with creativity: too many ideas. I find this is especially true when it comes to writing lyrics in the songwriting process. Over the years, by experience and study, I've stumbled upon this idea of writing in "lyrical keys," and I've found that it really helps the forward momentum of the creative process and allows new avenues of self-expression.</p>

<p>In any creative act, adding some sort of limitation, while seemingly contradictory to creativity, actually allows for creative expression to flourish. A painter or designer imposes a limitation of a color palette (blue series by that one painter). A sculptor chooses a particular material or medium with which to make his or her sculpture (you can't do the same things with metal, stone, or wood). A musician or composer will pick a key in which to write or play. A lyricist, likewise, can pick a lyrical key to limit the vocabulary used in song.</p>
