summary: This is my very first blog post. Basically, I'm going to give you the run-down on my I'm deciding to finally start a blog. It's taken forever for me to actually do it, and we're going to go over what motivated me to do it once and for all.

<p>This is new for me, I don't really do this sort of thing. I've never been the kind to keep a journal. I mean, I've written things, but it's always been poetry, or songs, or something of the sort. But I'm the kid who never even took notes in class.</p>

<p>That being said, I've decided to take up the hefty and heroic task of writing a <i>blog</i>.</p>

<p>I'll definitely give credit where it's due: I owe a lot of this endeavor to this <i>blog post</i> here: <a href="http://greig.cc/journal/2016/2/why-you-should-write?utm_source=designernews">if you click on these colored words the internet will magically take you to a different page</a>.</p>


<p> If you're an American and your superpower is being too busy and you don't have time to read the article I linked, here's the TL;DR:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Writing is like cleaning out your brain-closet's old clothes so you can get new, swaggier brain clothing!</li>
  <li>Writing makes you seem legitimate to other people who read words you write about stuff!</li>
  <li>Writing words for the things in your brain helps your brainthoughts make more sense!</li>
</ol>

<p>So yeah, those are some of the reasons I'm starting a blog...</p>

<h2 class="text-center">BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!</h2>

<p>I'm in a learning stage. I'm learning a <strong>TON!</strong></p>

<p>Because of that, there are two more reasons why I intend to blog henceforth:</p>
<ol>
  <li>I forget things really easily, and it'll be nice to have a reference for myself to revisit when my brain leaks out all its learning liquids.</li>
  <li>I want to help other people learn, too! I figure there has to be at least one other person out there who is trying to learn all the stuff I'm learning and would benefit from reading the things I type in to a computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>So that about covers the bases for why I'm starting a blog. Make sure you click the <i>secret link</i> in the bottom right to join my secret club!</p>

<p>Just for fun, here's some clipart of a kid learning:</p>
