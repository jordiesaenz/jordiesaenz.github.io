<p>I used to be intimidated by the idea of designing things, which makes sense, since I didn’t really have any idea what design really was.</p>


<p>What scared me away initially was that I didn’t consider myself an artist in the visual realm. I liked to create art with words and noises, but making something out of nothing for other people to look at with their eyeballs is definitely not my forte. I just can’t do visual art well. Don’t believe me? I was once asked to help make wedding invitations. My only task involved using scissors to cut out the invitations. After about three invitations, everybody realized that I literally am incapable of cutting straight lines.</p>


<p>I’m just straight up bad at visual art.</p>


<p>One of my coworkers / friends is a designer by trade, and I’ve started to try to learn from him. Any time I’d ask him for pointers, he would tell me to look at other things that people are doing, and to recreate it.</p>

<p>This was mind-boggling for me. Copying people?! How is that artsy and creative and brilliant at all?!</p>


<p>That’s when it hit me:</p>
<p>Art and Design are different.</p>


<p>This isn’t to say that they’re mutually exclusive of completely unrelated. It’s just that they’re different. Bear with me, I’ll try to explain:</p>

<p>Here’s an my definition of art:</p>

<p><em>the application of skill and creativity to deliver personal or collective expression of emotions, ideas, or values by appealing to any or all of the five senses</em></p>

<p>and here’s my definition of design:</p>

<p><em>the application of skill and creativity to accomplish a particular goal by appealing to any or all of the five senses</em></p>

<p>See the difference? Art is about expression, and design is about accomplishing a goal.</p>

<p>For example, somebody can make art out of language, we call that poetry. One can also design language for a particular goal, like somebody writing a sales letter. That would be design.</p>


<p>Once I started wrapping my mind around these ideas, I started seeing it everywhere.</p>

<p>When I was a angsty, emo teenager (before I was the angsty, emo adult I am presently), I hated pop music with a fiery passion. I questioned the value of it, because I didn’t see much expression or art in it. Bright Eyes was literally crying on half of his songs, pouring his heart out, while the radio was all about smacking booties all on the flo’. Plus, those songs on the radio weren’t even written by the people singing them! They had a whole team of writers and producers making that song!</p>

<p>Knowing what I do now, I appreciate pop music so much. It’s brilliant, because it’s so well-designed. The songs on the radio were written for a particular goal: to be hit songs on the radio. And they accomplish their goal so darn well! We live in an age of so many great song designers. Again, musical art and musical design aren’t mutually exclusive. One can deliver art through the design of a catchy song. Like Bieber’s new album. Fire.</p>

<p>This idea of art and design is everywhere. Abstract photoshoot? Art. Product photography? Design. Jackson Pollack? Art (I guess). A portrait? design.</p>

<p>So there you have it. Those are my thoughts about design and art as of right now. I’ll probably have different thoughts at some point, but for now, that’s what I think.</p>
