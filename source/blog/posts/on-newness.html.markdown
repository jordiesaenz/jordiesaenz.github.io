<p>Lately, I’ve been experiencing a lot of newness, which has led to lots of thinking about newness, which brought me to write a new blog post. About newness.</p>

<p>If you've read any of my posts or visited my website before, you'll notice that things look a little different. I decided to embrace the whole topic of newness and give my website a new look. Pretty spiffy, eh?</p>

<p>New things (places, people, objects, information, etc.) bring with them a whole slew of other things. Relationships, habits, ideas, creations, and opportunities all come about through embracing newness in life. If you’d be so kind as to lend me your eyes for a few minutes, I’d love to tell you a few stories about newness in my not-so-distant past:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>My Newness Story #1</h3>

<p>Recently, I moved in to a new apartment in my hometown. I love it. It’s a 5-minute walk from one of the lake, which is one of my favorite places in the world. I even got married there. I love being in new locations, especially new living spaces. It’s a clean slate for new decorations and new habits.</p>

<p>Since moving in, I’ve begun to embrace a couple new habits. I’m walking a whole lot more. My old apartment wasn’t a prime location for walking. There were a ton of hills. Admittedly, there was a little ravine with a woodsy trail, but it was kind of far. And there was a crazy steep hill that worked my glutes way too much (it’s hard to find pants that fit my butt as it is). However, my new apartment’s location is magical, to say the least. There are a handful of stores and restaurants in walking distance. I can walk to my favorite bar. There’s also a new Boba place less than a mile away, which is a godsend my go-to place is closed for renovations.</p>

<p>I find myself walking a TON, and I’m incredibly thankful for my new location, since I hate being in cars (they’re so small and stuffy). I’m able to do a lap around the lake and listen to audiobooks, which has been refreshing for my body and for my soul. I’m starting to wake up earlier so I can get some of this refreshment before starting my day. Embracing the newness of my living situation is allowing me to take advantage of things that I wasn’t really before, bettering myself physically and spiritually.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>My Newness Story #2</p>

<p>Over the past couple months, I’ve gotten some new music equipment: a new amp and a new guitar. My setup sounds a whole lot different than my previous one. While all the notes on the guitar are the same, the sound is fresh to me; the tone is new to my ears. Because of that, I’ve found myself playing guitar differently. Whereas before, I was playing to the warm sound of my old setup, I’m now playing to the chime-y sound of my new setup. Embracing the new sound has led to a new approach in how I am playing and writing music.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>My Newness Story #3</h3>

<p>I re-enrolled in school. I’m 23 years old and I don’t have a degree, and I’m probably 1-2 years out from getting one. I don’t really care about degrees and stuff, I just want to learn things, and my dad offered to pay, so what the H-E-double-hockey-sticks. I’m taking a course on Ethics this summer, in which I’ve been reading hundreds of pages of different perspectives on ethics, all new to me. This has been intellectually and spiritually stimulating. All this new information has been causing me to think deeply about Goodness, where it comes from, how one arrives at it, and who I want to become. I find myself setting aside more time for silence and contemplation, trying to get a big picture of my own life.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>There is always something good that comes out of newness. That good can be either a discovery of a new good (“I tried a new sushi place for the first time, and now I know I love it!”), or a reinforcement of a previously held good (“I tried a new sushi place, and now I know I don’t like it, and I’ve very appreciative of the sushi place I normally visit!”).</p>

<p>In the recent Adventures of Jordie Saenz, you can see how new places, new things, and new information has been having an impact in my life. I’m developing new habits, creating in a new way, and wrestling with new, existential ideas concerning my future and who I might become. I’m excited for new things in the future, whether they’re circumstances in which I find myself, people I meet, or things I create. Speaking of which, I’m releasing new music soon. Keep your ears peeled.</p>

<p>How are you embracing newness, and how are you benefitting from doing so? What new activities are you doing? What new people are you meeting and getting to know? How are you introducing newness into the lives of others around you?</p>
