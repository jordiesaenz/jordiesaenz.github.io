        <blockquote class="margin-top">
          I'm weeding out<br/>
          the death in me,<br/>
          and killing all<br/>
          my enemies.<br/>
          <br/>
          I wield this sword<br/>
          for victory;<br/>
          I'm waging war<br/>
          on what's unseen.<br/>
          <br/>
          But God, my chest would like to think<br/>
          there's still a heart of stone in me.<br/>
          And though my mortal flesh is weak,<br/>
          the son of man's alive in me,<br/>
          and he will kill what's killing me.<br/>
          <br/>
          So beat your ploughshares into swords,<br/>
          and consecrate yourselves for war<br/>
          against the men you were before,<br/>
          who were crucified and are no more.<br/>
          <br/>
          But God, my chest would like to think<br/>
          there's still a heart of stone in me.<br/>
          And though my mortal flesh is weak,<br/>
          the son of man's alive in me.<br/>
          <br/>
          Though I've sabotaged those dear to me,<br/>
          and torched all that's in my vicinity,<br/>
          though I've caused a cosmic mutiny,<br/>
          I partake in this divinity.<br/>
          <br/>
          Though I've flirted with futility,<br/>
          and kissed the lips on infidelity,<br/>
          though I'm drenched in my depravity,<br/>
          I partake in this divinity.
